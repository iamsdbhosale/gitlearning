Note: switching to '6eff9ca89c8a47c58c4cc1236e30d34720ef9267'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 6eff9ca Initial commit

Question :
Please resolve - "remote: Permission to Dexo145/DEX.git denied to iamsdbhosale. 
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Dexo145/DEX.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403"

ChatGPT :
That error means you're trying to push code to a GitHub repository you don’t have permission to write to. You're logged in as iamsdbhosale, but the repo belongs to Dexo145.

🔍 Why it happens :
You're trying to push to https://github.com/Dexo145/DEX.git, but:
	You're not the owner, or
	You're not added as a collaborator on that repo.

✅ Solutions
✅ Option 1: Get access to the original repo
If you’re supposed to push to Dexo145/DEX:
	Ask the owner (Dexo145) to add you as a collaborator:
		Go to the repo > Settings > Collaborators > add iamsdbhosale

	Accept the invite in your email or GitHub notifications.

	Then retry the push:

git push -u origin main
✅ Option 2: Push to your own GitHub repo instead
If you just want to upload your project, do this:

Go to GitHub

Create a new repository under your account (iamsdbhosale)

Copy the new URL (e.g., https://github.com/iamsdbhosale/your-repo-name.git)

Change the remote URL in your local project:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/iamsdbhosale/your-repo-name.git

Then push:
git push -u origin main
